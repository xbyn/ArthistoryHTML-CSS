            <h1>The Gross Clinic</h1>
            <h3>- Artist: Thomas Eakins</h3>
            <h3>- Year: 1875 </h3>
            <p>
                Philadelphia artist Thomas Eakins spent a year working on "The Gross Clinic," which he painted specifically for his hometown's 1876 Centennial Exhibition. The closely observed work depicts Dr. Samuel Gross and associates operating on a patient's leg.
                A stricken woman hiding her face from the open gash has been traditionally identified as the faceless patient's mother. Sitting behind Gross, to the right of the painting, is a self-portrait of the artist. Jurists, shocked by the gory realism, rejected the work, which was eventually housed in a reconstruction of a U.S. Army Post Hospital

            <h1>Arnolfini Portrait</h1>
            <h3>- Artist: Jan van Eyck </h3>
               <h3>- Year: 1434 </h3> 
            <p>
                Painted by Dutch master Jan van Eyck, this early Netherlandish panel painting is shrouded in symbolism. The elegantly dressed couple are thought to be Giovanni di Nicolao di Arnolfini, and his wife, Costanza Trenta, wealthy Italians living in Bruges.
                The unusual composition begs several questions. Does the painting celebrate the couple's wedding or commemorate another event, such as a shrewdly negotiated marriage contract? 
                Was the bride pregnant or simply dressed in the latest fashion? And what are the mysterious figures depicted in the convex mirror? 
                The unorthodox placement of van Eyck's signature directly above it suggests one of the men may be the artist himself.

                <h3>- Year: 1793 </h3>
            <p>The pallid figure bleeding out in Jacques-Louis David's 1793 neoclassical masterpiece is none other than Jean-Paul Marat, the French revolutionary famously stabbed to death in the bath by political adversary Charlotte Corday.
                David gravitated toward radical politics, aligning himself with the Jacobin ideologies of Marat and Maximilien Robespierre. In post-revolutionary France, he rose to the position of court painter under Napoléon Bonaparte

<h1>What did Socrates say about art? </h1>

<div class="row">
    <div class="opin-col">
        <img src="image/Socrate_du_Louvre.jpg" >
        <div>
            <p>
                Socrates defines art as imitation. 
                He then declares that it is very easy to get perfect imitations — by means of mirrors. 
                His intent is to show that art belongs to the domain of reflections, shadows, illusions, dreams.
